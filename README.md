Project Checklist
------------

### Week 1

- [x] Create a git repository
- [x] All members have write access to repository
- [x] Using dedicated environment to keep track of packages
- [x] File structure made using cookiecutter
- [x] make_dataset.py filled to download needed data
- [x] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
- [ ] Done profiling and optimized code
- [x] requirements.txt filled with used dependencies
- [ ] Write unit tests for some part of the codebase and get code coverage
- [x] Get some continues integration running on the github repository
- [ ] use either tensorboard or wandb to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in your code
- [x] remember to comply with good coding practices while doing the project

### Week 2

- [ ] Setup and used Azure to train your model
- [ ] Played around with distributed data loading
- [ ] (not curriculum) Reformated your code in the pytorch lightning format
- [ ] Deployed your model using Azure
- [ ] Checked how robust your model is towards data drifting
- [ ] Deployed your model locally using TorchServe

### Week 3
